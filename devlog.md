# Development Log
> A successful final project is built slowly over many weeks not thrown together at the last minute. To incentivize good project pacing and to let your project mentor stay informed about the status of your work, each week you should add an entry to your log.md file in the development directory.

> Each entry should describe:

> - What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not
> - What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals
> - What you plan to accomplish or attempt next week

> The development log will be graded for completion, detail, and honesty â€“ not progress. It is much better to truthfully evaluate the work you completed in a week then lie to make the project sound further along then it really is. It is totally acceptable to have an entry that says you tried nothing and accomplished nothing. However if every week starts to say that, both yourself and your project mentor will be able to identify the issue before it becomes impossible to fix.

## Week 5 (26 Jul - 1 Aug)
Started learning Pygame using the link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org... Hope I can learn how to use it (checked)
Created project and followed along the guid, created pixel art hearts for lives and a steel heart for the player
Made the intro music using GarageBand :)
Forgot to update the dev logs...

## Week 6 (2 Aug - 8 Aug)
Continued to figure out the wise ways of Sir freeCodeCamp.org. Found alot of bugs... Managed to add a bullet and move it accross the screen and deal damage to the player. Trying to figure out how to have a 'reload' timer. Progress so far seems quite good. Once the main gam mechanics are done I can move on to creating other stages and maybe? difficulties although I doubt so. Goals for the next 2 weeks:

1. title intro and screen
2. story boarding 
3. write the story
4. create 3 more stages
5. create alot more sprites
6. die screen
7. more music
8. a proper name
