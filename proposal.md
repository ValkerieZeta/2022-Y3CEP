# General description of project
Create a bullet H - E - double Golf Clubs game where you control a character to dodge bullets

#Goals of project
Create a playable (and fun?) bullt H - E - Double Floorball Sticks.

# Listing of features
The game will have a story (similar to Undertale) before each stage

There will be 1 tutorial stage, 3 stages and 1 boss stage

There will be 3 modes, Easy, Hard and Impossible

The stages will increase in difficulty. The boss stage will be the hardest stage.

Additional details:

The space at which you are allowed to move in will increase and decrease (similar to Undertale) within the stage as the enemy uses different attacks

The difficulties can be selecte by the choices you choose in the story (for example, there will be 3 options to choose per stage. The player will face a situation in which he is required to pick 3 choices. The choice will range from the most morally appropriate to questionably suspicious. The nicer you are in these decisions, the more difficult the stage will be (e.g. if you chooes the meanest option, you have to face the hardest difficulty (impossible), but if you choose the nicest difficulty, you get to play the easiest difficulty).

# External Scanning
Undertale and other Bullet H - E - Double Hockey Sticks games. However, this will have a completely original storyline, and the designs itself will be different. I will also not refer to any code from other Bullet H - E - Double Candy Canes games in order to stay completely and hopefully original.
